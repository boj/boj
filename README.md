## Profile

My name is Brian Jones and I hail from Eagle River, Alaska. I moved back to this beautiful state in 2018 after having lived in Japan for 12 years. I enjoy hiking with my daughter and our two border collies.

I've worn both EM and IC hats throughout my career. For thoughts on how I approach management and leadership please see my [Manager README](https://managerreadme.com/readme/mojobojo).

As for software engineering, I've continued to delve deeper down the stack as time goes on. In my early days dynamic langauges were fun and exciting, however, I started leaning into typed languages with runtimes such as Go and Haskell, and now Rust as I become more interested in low level resource efficiency.

## Projects

Back when I was excited about Go I wrote a Riak (by Basho) database driver: https://github.com/riaken/riaken-core

I had the opportunity to build a Haskell team at one point. Wrote a streaming [telnet parser](https://github.com/alasconnect/pipes-telnet) or [two](https://github.com/alasconnect/streaming-network), as well as a highly commented demo of the [web stack](https://github.com/alasconnect/azure-demo) we landed on.

A lot of my Rust experimentation isn't public in the form of Bevy game engine code writing. My latest tool is [DepthZ](https://github.com/mta-solutions/depthz/) which helps graph systems and infrastructure dependencies.
