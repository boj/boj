## Profile

My name is Brian Jones and I hail from Eagle River, Alaska. I moved back to this beautiful state in 2018 after having lived in Japan for 12 years. I enjoy hiking with my daughter and our two border collies.

I've worn both EM and IC hats throughout my career. For thoughts on how I approach management and leadership please see my [Manager README](https://managerreadme.com/readme/mojobojo).

As for software engineering, I've continued to delve deeper down the stack as time goes on. In my early days dynamic langauges were fun and exciting, however, I started leaning into typed languages with runtimes such as Go and Haskell, and now Rust and Zig as I become more interested in low level resource efficiency and systems programming.

## Projects

Back when I was excited about Go I wrote a Riak (by Basho) database driver: https://github.com/riaken/riaken-core

I had the opportunity to build a Haskell team at one point. Here is a highly commented demo of the [web stack](https://github.com/alasconnect/azure-demo) we landed on.

My latest Rust tool is [DepthZ](https://github.com/mta-solutions/depthz/) which helps graph systems and infrastructure dependencies.

I'm [tinkering with Zig](https://github.com/boj/zany) by writing components of a command line edior.
