## Not LinkedIn

I deleted both LinkedIn and Facebook back around 2013 with a growing uncomfortableness about social media. As someone who supports free software and control over their own information I've made (some) effort to dislodge control over where my data goes, especially if there is a plain text alternative I can throw in a git repo.

## Profile

My name is Brian Jones and I hail from Eagle River, Alaska. I moved back to this beautiful state in 2018 after having lived in Japan for 12 years.

I've worn both EM and IC hats throughout my career. For thoughts on how I approach management and leadership please see my [Manager README](https://managerreadme.com/readme/mojobojo).

As for software engineering, I've continued to delve deeper down the stack as time goes on. In my early days dynamic langauges were fun and exciting, however, I started leaning into typed languages with runtimes such as Go and Haskell, and now Rust as I become more interested in low level resource efficiency.

## Projects

Back when I was excited about Go I wrote a Riak (by Basho) database driver: https://github.com/riaken/riaken-core

I had the opportunity to build a Haskell team at one point. Wrote a streaming [telnet parser](https://github.com/alasconnect/pipes-telnet) or [two](https://github.com/alasconnect/streaming-network), as well as a highly commented demo of the [web stack](https://github.com/alasconnect/azure-demo) we landed on.

A lot of my Rust experimentation isn't public in the form of Bevy game engine code writing. However, I do have this [web crawler](https://github.com/boj/dewww) which conceptually was going to be a p2p search engine, and a [software RISC-V](https://github.com/boj/prisma-risc-v) implementation that I can't take much credit for as I was following guides (was a great assembly refresher though).
